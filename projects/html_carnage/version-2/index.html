Section 1:

<p><strong>HTML</strong> stands for "Hypertext Markup Language", in which "hypertext" means a string of texts contains a hyperlink and "markup language" refers to <q>a text-encoding system consisting of a set of symbols inserted in a text document to control its structure, formatting, or the relationship between its parts.</q> Another example of markup language is XML (eXtensible Markup Language).</p>

<p>Simply put, HTML is a markup language for hypertext. It is a language for creating webpage, defining its structure and giving meaning to different blocks of text for a browser to render. Everything we see in the internet, more or less, contains HTML.</p>

<p>By "marking up" various parts with tags, HTML describes the structure of a webpage and tells User Agents (UAs) - most typical example is a browser, how to render/display the content. Tags define HTML elements and each of them may associate with certain attributes, which some specific whereas some global.</p>

<p>The latest version of HTML is HTML5. It was release in 2014 (the older version was HTML4.1, which was in practice since 1999). Compared with the previous versions, HTML5 introduced many interesting features and is considered much easier to use.</p>

<p>It is important to bear in mind that HTML is the backbone of the web and it has not stopped evolving since then. Along these years, there is ongoing adjustment to HTML in order to match the need following the rapid development of the internet.</p>

Section 2:

<p>SEO stands for <strong>Search Engine Optimization</strong>. The importance of SEO, in particular in Internet Marketing, can be summarized as below,</p>

<blockquote>"SEO is performed because a website will receive more visitors from a search engine when websites rank higher on the search engine results page (SERP). These visitors can then potentially be converted into customers."</blockquote> <cite> - Wikipedia</cite>

<p>...to be fair, even if it is not for boosting the number of potential customers, it is reasonable that one still wants their webpage to be found and be seen by others - that has been the spirit of internet from very beginning, to interconnect with others. </p>

<p>In past, the algorithm which search engines employed heavily relied on the information provided by the webmasters/content providers. The latter could improve the ranking of their webpages by, for example, adding repeating or even inaccurate search terms / keywords in the metadata. Needless to say more, the search result may appear many irrelevant webpages due to the aforesaid manipulation from the side of webmasters.</p>

<p>To respond such behaviour, search engines started to developing more complex ranking algorithms which calculate the score of webpage in aspect of semantic signals holistically.</p>

        <h2 id="reasons">Reasons for clearer HTML</h2>
            <section>
                <p>Before heading to the reasons for writing HTML in a clear and semantic manner, it is crucial to know <em>SEO</em>.</p>
                <article>
                    <p>SEO stands for <strong>Search Engine Optimization</strong>. The importance of SEO, in particular in Internet Marketing, can be summarized as below,</p>
                    
                    <blockquote>"SEO is performed because a website will receive more visitors from a search engine when websites rank higher on the search engine results page (SERP). These visitors can then potentially be converted into customers."<cite> - Wikipedia</cite></blockquote> 
                    
                    <p>...to be fair, even if it is not for boosting the number of potential customers, it is reasonable that one still wants their webpage to be found and be seen by others - that has been the spirit of internet from very beginning, to interconnect with others. </p>
                    
                    <p>In past, the algorithm which search engines employed heavily relied on the information provided by the webmasters/content providers. The latter could improve the ranking of their webpages by, for example, adding repeating or even inaccurate search terms / keywords in the metadata.

                    <p>To respond such behaviour, search engines started to developing more complex ranking algorithms which calculate the score of webpage in aspect of semantic signals holistically.</p>

                    <p>That is one of the main reasons and is quite a strong enough reason alone for us to sharpen own HTML skills. HTML may be plain and not very complicated to learn (seemingly). Nonetheless, it is all about semantics which is crucial for SEO and therefore deserves to receive our attention. It is the foundation always being here (as of now, at least).</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Avoid abusing &#60;div&#62; and &#60;span&#62;.<br /><br />There are tons of alternative with built-in features provided by HTML5 (we will cover that more in other parts on this page).</li>
                    <li>Be discreet when giving name to the class/ID for elements, be specific (avoid using numbering as class name, ie picture1-6 but picture-left/picture-center). </li>
                    <li>Have a more compound class attribute with a string of generic classes which could be reuseable - like the way Bootstrap is.</li>
                    <li>Use lowercase for elements, attributes and also values, for better readability and consistency.</li>
                    <li>Use labels for labelable elements for better machine readability.</li>
                    <li>Always think of the possibilities of incompatibility and prepare alternative ways as fall-back.</li>
                    <li>Use &#60;h1&#62; only once per page.</li>
